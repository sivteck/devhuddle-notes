  - data types, relationships and constraints that apply to the data
- conceptual data model eg. entity-relationship model

Relational Model
- The relational model represents the database as a collection of relations.
  - column header - attribute
  - row - tuple
  - data type - domain
  - relations - set of n-tuples

Super Key - uniqueness constraint that no two distinct tuples in any state r of R can have the same value for SK
- each of the keys is a candidate key
- can designate one of the keys as primary keys
